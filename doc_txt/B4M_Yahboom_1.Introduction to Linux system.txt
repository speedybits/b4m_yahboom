Linux major versions

There are currently about 300 Linux distributions, almost all of which can be run as server 
systems. Linux distributions rarely copy each other. The following are the main popular Linux 
server distributions:

Red Hat Enterprise Linux (Red Hat Enterprise Linux): This is the first Linux distribution for the 
commercial market. It is available in server versions and supports numerous processor 
architectures.

Debian: Debian is extremely stable, which makes it ideal for servers.

CentOS: CentOS is an enterprise Linux distribution built from the ground up using free source 
code from Red Hat Enterprise Linux. This refactored version completely removes the registered 
trademark and a very subtle change in the Binary package.

Ubuntu: Ubuntu is a derivative of Debian that focuses on its application in this market and is 
common on servers, cloud computing, and even some mobile devices running Ubuntu Linux.
