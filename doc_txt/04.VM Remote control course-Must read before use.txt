Must read before use  
After getting the car, you need to set the IP and ROS_DOMAIN_ID. The former is to connect to the 
agent, and the latter is to interact with the virtual machine. Distributed multi-machine communication

1、Set up the board to connect to wifi  
Modify the config_robot.py code in the /home/yahboom directory and find the following parts,

robot.set_wifi_config("ssid123", "passwd123")

Change ssid123 to your own WiFi name, and change passws123 to the password corresponding to 
your own WiFi. Save and exit after modification.

2、Set IP  
Taking the virtual machine provided by yahboom as an example, query the current IP of the virtual 
machine and enter in the terminal

ifconfig

As can be seen from the picture, the query here shows that my IP is 192.168.2.133. This is the IP when 
we start the agent, so we need to set the board to this. IP can connect to the proxy

Use a USB to Type-C cable to connect the board and the virtual machine, and make sure the virtual 
machine is connected to the board.



Then modify the test_microros.py code in the /home/yahboom directory and find the following parts,

robot.set_udp_config([192, 168, 2, 133], 8090)

Change [192, 168, 2, 133] here to the ip you queried

Assume that robot.set_ros_domain_id(20) is set to 20, then modify the config_robot.py file as follows,

robot.set_ros_domain_id(20)

Change the 20 inside to a custom number, which cannot exceed 100.

After the modification is completed, save and exit, and run it in the terminal.

cd ~

sudo python3 config_robot.py

If the following screen appears, it means the modification is successful. The content in the picture 
shall be subject to the actual modification. Then you need to restart the board to take effect.

2、Virtual machine settings ROS_DOMAIN_ID  
Then you also need to set the same ROS_DOMAIN_ID in the ~/.bashrc file of the virtual machine to 
achieve distributed multi-machine communication between the board and the virtual machine.

Modify the ~/.bashrc file of the virtual machine and enter it in the terminal.

sudo gedit .bashrc



Find ROS_DOMAIN_ID and set it to be consistent with robot.set_ros_domain_id(20) set in 1,

Assume that the setting is 20, fill in 20 here, then save and exit, reopen the terminal, the terminal will 
display the set ROS_DOMAIN_ID value,

3. Test whether the modification is completed  
Enter the following command in the virtual machine terminal to enable the agent:

sudo docker run -it --rm -v /dev:/dev -v /dev/shm:/dev/shm --privileged --net=host 

microros/micro-ros-agent:humble udp4 --port 8090 -v4



Then, turn on the car switch and wait for the car to connect to the agent. The connection is successful, 
as shown in the figure below.

Then reopen a terminal and enter the following command to query the currently running node:

ros2 node list



When the car is connected to the agent, a node program will be run. If the node can be queried on the 
virtual machine, it means that the two have achieved distributed multi-machine communication.

Note: When running any routine, the agent only needs to be started normally once. Repeatedly 
starting the agent will cause the agent to report an error. If you need to restart the agent

The manager needs to ensure that the last agent used is shut down before starting again.
