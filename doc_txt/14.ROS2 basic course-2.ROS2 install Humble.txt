2.ROS2 install Humble  
 

1. Set the language environment  
Please first check whether the local language environment supports UTF-8 encoding. You can call the 
following command to check and set UTF-8 encoding.

locale  # Check for support of UTF-8

sudo apt update && sudo apt install locales

sudo locale-gen en_US en_US.UTF-8

sudo update-locale LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 LANG=en_US.UTF-8

export LANG=en_US.UTF-8

locale  # Verify that the settings are successful

Note: The locale can be different, but must support UTF-8 encoding

 

2. Set software source  
Start the Ubuntu universe repository

sudo apt install software-properties-common

sudo add-apt-repository universe

Add the ROS 2 apt repository to the system and authorize our GPG key with apt

sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl -y

sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key -o 

/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg

Add repository to sources list

echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ros-

archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release && echo 

$UBUNTU_CODENAME) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list > /dev/null

 

3. Install Humble  
First update the apt repository cache:

sudo apt update



Then upgrade the installed software (ROS2 packages are built on Ubuntu systems which are 
frequently updated, please make sure your system is up to date before installing new packages):

sudo apt upgrade

Install the desktop version of ROS2 (recommended), including: ROS, RViz, examples and tutorials. The 
installation command is as follows:

sudo apt install ros-humble-desktop python3-argcomplete

Install colcon build tools

sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions

 

4. Configure environment  
Under the terminal, when executing the ROS2 program, you need to call the following command to 
configure the environment:

source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash

Every time you open a new terminal, you must execute the above command, or you can also execute 
the following command to write the configuration environment instructions into the "~/.bashrc" file. 
Then every time you start a new terminal, you do not need to manually configure the environment.

echo "source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc

So far, ROS2 has been installed and configured.

 

5. About uninstallation  
After ROS2 is installed, if you want to uninstall ROS2, you can execute the following command:

sudo apt remove ~nros-humble-* && sudo apt autoremove

You can also delete the corresponding repository of ROS2:

sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list

sudo apt update

sudo apt autoremove

# Consider upgrading for packages previously shadowed.

sudo apt upgrade
