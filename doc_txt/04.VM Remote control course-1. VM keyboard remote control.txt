VM keyboard remote control  
Note: The virtual machine needs to be in the same LAN as the car, and the ROS_DOMAIN_ID needs to 
be consistent. You can check [Must read before use] to set the IP and ROS_DOMAIN_ID on the board.

Here we take the [PS2-2.4G wireless controller] sold by Yabo Intelligent Technology Co., Ltd. as an 
example to explain how to quickly start the program and control the car. The code here only applies 
to the above handles, other handles are not applicable.

1. Start and connect to the agent  
Taking the supporting virtual machine as an example, enter the following command to start the 
agent，

sudo docker run -it --rm -v /dev:/dev -v /dev/shm:/dev/shm --privileged --net=host 

microros/micro-ros-agent:humble udp4 --port 8090 -v4

Then, turn on the car switch and wait for the car to connect to the agent. The connection is successful, 
as shown in the figure below.



Then, connect the controller's receiver to the virtual machine's host and choose to connect to the 
virtual machine.

2. Start the handle control program  
Take the supporting virtual machine as an example, enter in the terminal,

ros2 run joy joy_node

ros2 run yahboomcar_ctrl yahboom_joy

After the program starts, observe the handle indicator light. If it stays on, it means the connection is 
successful. Press [START] and the car's buzzer will sound. Press the R1 button to turn on the handle 
control. You can use the left joystick to control the car forward and backward; you can use the right 
joystick left and right to control the car to turn left and right; you can control the linear speed and 
angular speed of the car by pressing the left and right remote sensors.
