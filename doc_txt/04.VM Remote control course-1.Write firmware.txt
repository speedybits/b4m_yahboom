1. Install CP2102 serial port driver
2. Download the Flash tool
3. Configure the burning tool 
4. Start writing firmware
5. Flashing completed
6. Check the factory firmware

Note: The microROS control board has been burned with factory firmware before leaving 
the factory. If you have not burned other firmware before, you do not need to burn the 
factory firmware again. 

The factory firmware of the microROS control board only provides bin files for burning, and 
does not provide program source code. 

 

1. Install CP2102 serial port driver  
If the Windows system has already installed the CP2102 serial port driver, you can skip this step.

The path of the CP2102 serial port driver file is in [Hardware related information] -> [CP2102 serial 
port chip] -> [CP2102-Windows driver file.zip] in the supporting information.

After decompression, you will get the [CP2102-Windows-driver] folder. Select x64 and x86 
according to the system version. Here we take 64-bit Win10 as an example. Double-click to open 
the [CP210xVCPInstaller_x64.exe] file and click Next to start the installation.

 

After the driver installation is completed, the prompt status is [Ready for use], click Finish.



Use a Type-C cable to connect the type-c serial port of the expansion board to the USB port of the 
computer

Open the [Device Manager] of the Windows system and see the CP210x device in [Port], which 
means the driver installation is successful.



 

2. Download the Flash tool  
Download URL:

https://www.espressif.com.cn/zh-hans/support/download/other-tools

 

Unzip to get flash_download_tool, double-click to open it.

As shown in the figure below, select the serial port to burn ESP32-S3. Click OK to open the burning 
tool.



 

3. Configure the burning tool  
In 'SPIDownload', select the firmware microROS_Robot_Vx.x.x.bin to be burned to ESP32S3, where 
Vx.x.x is the firmware version number, enter 0x0 for the firmware address, check DoNotChgBin, 
and then select the connected COM port. Keep other configurations as default.

Firmware name Firmware address Remark

microROS_Robot_Vx.x.x.bin 0x0 Factory firmware bin file

 

4. Start writing firmware  
Click the Start button and the tool will automatically start burning firmware.



Note: If the firmware burning does not start automatically, please press and hold the boot0 key 
first, then press the reset button, release the boot0 key, and enter the burning mode manually.

 

5. Flashing completed  
After the download is completed, a blue FINISH logo will appear. At this time, power off and 
restart the microcontroller or press the reset button to start the program.

 

6. Check the factory firmware  
The storage path of the serial port assistant software is [Hardware related information]->[CP2102 
serial port chip]->[UartAssist.exe] in the supporting information.

Open the serial port assistant, as shown in the figure below, select the serial port of the microROS 
control board, the baud rate is 115200, 8-bit data, 1-bit stop, no parity, and no flow control.

Press the reset button on the microROS control board, find the hello Yahboom prompt in the 
printed debugging information, and check the firmware version number in the line below. If the 
information is correct, it means the factory firmware has been burned successfully.
