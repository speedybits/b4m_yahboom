Connection module proxy  
1、Enable proxy  
If using a factory produced virtual machine system, you can input it at the terminal：

sh ~/start_Camera_computer.sh

 

If using a third-party virtual machine system, you need to first install the Docker development 
environment and open the terminal input：

docker run -it --rm -v /dev:/dev -v /dev/shm:/dev/shm --privileged --net=host 

microros/micro-ros-agent:humble udp4 --port 9999 -v4

 

2、Connection proxy  
After all the previous tutorials have been configured and confirmed to be correct,

Turn on the power switch of the car and automatically connect to the proxy. The connection is 
successful as shown in the following figure

Attention: If the connection is not successful, please check and confirm whether the ROS wifi 
image transmission module can be connected to the local area network normally, and whether 
the proxy IP address corresponds.

 



3、Test ROS nodes  
Open the ROS2 terminal environment and enter the following command to view the 
/espRos/Esp32Node node name

ros2 node list

If the/espRos/Esp32Node node cannot be searched, please check and confirm that the ROS 
DOMAIN ID of the. bashrc file on the virtual machine/computer must be 20. The ROS DOMAIN ID 
of the micro car must also be 20, otherwise the car cannot perform AI visual gameplay.

 

4、Viewing camera images  
1. Open the terminal of the factory's virtual machine system and input

ros2 run yahboom_esp32_camera sub_img

2. If the camera is facing downwards and not in the middle, open a new terminal and enter

(This step requires the virtual machine to connect to the agent of the car,How to connect can 



be found in the Quick Start Chapter)

ros2 run yahboom_esp32_mediapipe control_servo

Wait for the camera to move in the middle, press "Ctrl+C" to terminate the program。

If the camera rudder maneuvers and does not return to the center, it is necessary to 
reinstall the camera while ensuring continuous power supply.


3. If the camera is inverted, open a new terminal input

python3 ~/SET_Camera.py 



Then enter the IP address to connect to the ROS wifi image transmission module, which can be 
viewed at the terminal that connects to the ROS wifi image transmission module proxy


Enter the IP address at the terminal based on the detected IP address, and then press enter




The image has been restored


If it is a third-party system, you need to port it yourself according to the feature package of 
yahboomcar_ws.
