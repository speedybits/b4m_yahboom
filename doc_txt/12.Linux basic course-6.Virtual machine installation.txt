Since the situation of each computer is different, settings can be made according to the actual 
situation. The higher the virtual machine memory setting, the faster the virtual machine will run, 
but do not exceed the maximum memory.



Processor: The higher the number of cores (c) per processor, the smoother the virtual machine 
will run, but it must not exceed the total number.



USB controller: USB compatibility is set to 【USB 3.1】, so that USB3.0 devices can be used.
