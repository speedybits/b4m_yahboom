Palm control 2DOF servo PTZ  
Note: The VM and ROS-wifi image transfer module must be consistent with the microROS control 
board ROS_DOMAIN_ID and set the value to 20. You can check [MicroROS control board 
Parameter configuration] to set the microROS control board ROS_DOMAIN_ID. Check the tutorial 
Connecting to MicroROS Agents to see if the ids are the same.

1、synopsis  
MediaPipe is an open source and data stream processing machine learning application 
development framework developed by Google. It is a graph-based data processing pipeline for 
building data sources that use many forms, such as video, audio, sensor data, and any time series 
data. MediaPipe is cross-platform and can run on embedded platforms (Raspberry PI, etc.), 
mobile devices (iOS and Android), workstations and servers, and supports GPU acceleration on 
mobile. MediaPipe provides cross-platform, customizable ML solutions for live and streaming 
media.

2、Program specification  
After the program starts, after the camera captures the image, the two-dimensional head of the 
car will follow the movement of the palm in the picture. The moving speed of the palm movement 
here should not be too fast, otherwise the image processing can not keep up, which will cause a 
lag.

2.1、Program code reference path  

/home/yahboom/yahboomcar_ws/src/yahboom_esp32ai_car/yahboom_esp32ai_car/control_

shape.py

3、Program initiation  
3.1、Start command  
Terminal input,

ros2 run yahboom_esp32ai_car control_shape 

If the Angle of the camera is not at this Angle, please press CTRL+C to end the program and 
run again, this is because the network delay causes the Angle of sending the steering gear 
to lose packets


If the camera picture image appears upside down, you need to see 3. Camera picture 
correction (must see) document itself correction, the experiment is no longer described.

After the function is turned on, the two-dimensional head of the car will follow the palm 
movement.

Code parsing

1）、Import important library files

from media_library import *

2）、Check the hand, get finger information

frame, lmList, bbox = self.hand_detector.findHands(frame)

angle = self.hand_detector.ThumbTOforefinger(lmList)

3）、Calculate the Angle of each steering gear



point_x = lmList[9][1]

point_y = lmList[9][2]

if point_y >= 200: self.y -= 1

elif point_y <= 100: self.y += 1

if point_x >= 420: self.x -= 1

elif point_x <= 300: self.x += 1

if self.x <= -45: self.x = -45

elif self.x >= 45: self.x=45

if self.y <= -90: self.y = -90

elif self.y >=40: self.y = 40

It can be seen that indexX and indexY are the coordinates of the center point of the picture 
frame, and the Angle of rotation of the steering gear should be calculated through judgment. 
The parameters of each Angle calculation method are calibrated according to the actual 
rotation Angle and the visual range of the camera.
