Gesture control car movement  
Note: The VM and ROS-wifi image transfer module must be consistent with the microROS control 
board ROS_DOMAIN_ID and set the value to 20. You can check [MicroROS control board 
Parameter configuration] to set the microROS control board ROS_DOMAIN_ID. Check the tutorial 
Connecting to MicroROS Agents to see if the ids are the same.

1、Program function specification  

When the function is turned on, the camera captures images and recognizes gestures to control 
the car's movement.

Sign "5" Cart along

fist Car back

1 finger Car turn left

2 finger Car turn right

MediaPipe Hands extrapolates the 3D coordinates of 21 hand-valued joints from a single 
frame

2、Program code reference path  
After entering the docker container, the location of the feature source code is located,

/home/yahboom/yahboomcar_ws/src/yahboom_esp32ai_car/yahboom_esp32ai_car/HandCtrl

.py

3、Program initiation  
3.1、Program initiation  

Terminal input

ros2 run yahboom_esp32ai_car HandCtrl



If the camera Angle is not at this Angle, please press CTRL+C to end the program and run it 
again, this is because the network delay causes the Angle of sending the steering gear to 
lose packets.


If the camera picture image appears upside down, you need to see 3. Camera picture 
correction (must see) document itself correction, the experiment is no longer described.

Open the function, and then put your hand in front of the camera, the picture will draw the 
shape of the finger, the program recognizes the gesture, it will send the speed to the 
chassis, and then control the car movement.

4、Core code  
4.1、HandCtrl.py  

Import key library

from media_library import * 

Get finger data

frame, lmList, _ = self.hand_detector.findHands(frame)

fingers = self.hand_detector.fingersUp(lmList)

sum(fingers)

fingers[]



As you can see, it is first detected to get the value of lmList and then passed to the 
fingersUp function. The fingersUp function is used to detect which fingers are straight, the 
value of which is 1, and you can also see media_library,py function for a detailed 
explanation of the code, which is to determine the xy value of the finger joint to determine 
when it is straight. The sum(fingers) function is used to count the number of straight 
fingers, fingers[] can be used to enumerate fingers, such as the index finger, we use 
fingers[1].

Release speed to chassis
