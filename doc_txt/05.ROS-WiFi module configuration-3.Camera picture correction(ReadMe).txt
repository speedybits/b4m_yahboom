3.Camera picture correction(ReadMe)  
When installing the ROS wifi image transmission module, it is reversed, with the power supply 
port facing downwards. At this time, the camera image is inverted. As shown in the figure：


This requires setting up the camera screen, and the operation steps are as follows:

1. First, place the SET-Camera.py in the documentation on the Linux system, and it can be 
found anywhere

2. Then open the terminal in the directory with SET-Camera.py and run the command

python3 SET_Camera.py

3. At the terminal, enter the Docket terminal (command to open Docket, see 2. Connect ROS 
wifi image transmission module proxy) to obtain the IP address, and press Enter




4. When Camera is set OK The camera's image is reversed

If Camera is set OK does not appear for a long time! Check if the entered IP address is 
incorrect.
