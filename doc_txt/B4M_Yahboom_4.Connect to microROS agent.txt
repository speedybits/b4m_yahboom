Connect to microROS agent  
1. Start the agent  
If you are using the factory virtual machine system, you can enter in the terminal:

sh ~/start_agent_computer.sh

 

If you use a third-party virtual machine system, you need to install the docker development 
environment first, open a terminal and enter:

docker run -it --rm -v /dev:/dev -v /dev/shm:/dev/shm --privileged --net=host 

microros/micro-ros-agent:humble udp4 --port 8090 -v4

 

2. Connection agent  
Turn on the power switch of the car and automatically connect to the agent. The connection is 
successful as shown in the figure below.

Note: If the connection is not successful, please check and confirm the configuration parameters of 
the robot, whether it can connect to the LAN normally, and whether the proxy IP address and port 
number correspond.

 



3. Test ROS nodes  
Open the ROS2 terminal environment and enter the following command to view the /YB_Car_Node 
node name

ros2 node list

If the /YB_Car_Node node cannot be searched, please check and confirm that the ROS DOMAIN ID of 
the .bashrc file on the virtual machine/computer is consistent with the one configured on the 
microROS control board before the node information can be searched.
