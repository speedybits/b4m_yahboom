2. Backup (restore) system image on Windows

If you do not have a Linux operating system, you can also back up under Windows, but the size of the 
backed up file is actually the size of the SD card.

First create a new blank file with the .img suffix, then select read directly to back up the system, and 
then reinstall to restore it.
