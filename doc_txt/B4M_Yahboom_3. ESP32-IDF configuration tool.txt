1、Introduction to ESP32-IDF configuration tool  
In the root directory of the ESP32-IDF project, there is an sdkconfig file, which is used to store the 
configuration content of ESP32-IDF.

 

2、Activate the ESP-IDF development environment  
Run the following command in the esp-idf tool directory

source ~/esp/esp-idf/export.sh

Note: Every time you open a new terminal, you need to activate the ESP-IDF development 
environment before you can compile the ESP-IDF project.

 

3、New Construction  
Create a new blank project to use as a basic project.

mkdir ~/esp/Samples/esp32_samples

cd ~/esp/Samples/esp32_samples

idf.py create-project main

cd main

 

4、Configuration project  
Set the target chip to esp32s3 chip and open the configuration interface.

idf.py set-target esp32s3

idf.py menuconfig
