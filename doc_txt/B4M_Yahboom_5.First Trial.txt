This tutorial is just a simplified version, mainly paired with quick-start videos!

For detailed tutorial steps, please see the [Preparation before development] 

tutorial!

Software locations involved in getting started quickly:

Factory firmware: program source code summary

Virtual machine: virtual machine system

1、Burn MicroROS control board firmware  
Note: For users who have just received the product, the MicroROS control board does not need 
to burn the factory firmware.

Please check directly below for the tutorial on configuring the MicroROS control board

 



Our products will have firmware burned before leaving the factory. This video is 

mainly provided to users who need to burn firmware!

1.1、Serial device identification  
Device connection  

Use Type-C data cable to connect the computer and MicroROS control board.

Note: Burning firmware requires turning on the power switch of the MicroROS control board for 
power supply!

When connecting to the MicroROS control board for the first time, the system may not 

be able to correctly identify the serial device. We need to install the driver of 

the CP210X series.

Install serial device driver  

Open system device manager

If the device manager does not correctly identify the serial device, we need to install the CP210x series 
driver:

View device  

Check the corresponding serial device in the device manager port option.

1.2、Write factory firmware  
Factory firmware  

The firmware we demonstrate here：microROS_Robot_V0.0.4

The firmware may be upgraded later and the name may be slightly different, but the 

steps are the same.

Flash download tool  

We need to prepare the Flash download tool in advance:

1.3、Burn factory firmware  



Open the Flash download tool  

Software download mode  

Check the corresponding download tool mode option

The terminal can see the corresponding download information!

Download factory firmware  



Verify factory firmware  

Check the information printed by the MicroROS control board through the UartAssist software: After 
connecting the serial port, press the Reset button of the development board!

The serial port will print firmware version information!

 

2、VMware installation and use  
2.1、VMware installation  
VMware Workstation Player  

This version is free for non-commercial use.

https://www.vmware.com/cn/products/workstation-player.html



VMware Workstation Pro  

Commercial use requires payment, and you can experience the 30-day trial version.

https://www.vmware.com/cn/products/workstation-pro/workstation-pro-evaluation.html

2.2、VMware uses  
You need to download and decompress the virtual machine image provided in our information in 
advance

3、Configure MicroROS control board  
3.1、Parameter introduction  
Edit the config_robot.py file according to your own configuration

if __name__ == '__main__':

    robot = MicroROS_Robot(port='/dev/ttyUSB0', debug=False)

    robot.set_wifi_config("Yahboom2", "yahboom890729")

    robot.set_udp_config([192, 168, 2, 238], 8090)

    robot.set_car_type(robot.CAR_TYPE_COMPUTER)

    # robot.set_car_type(robot.CAR_TYPE_RPI5)

    robot.set_ros_domain_id(20)

    # robot.set_ros_serial_baudrate(921600)

    robot.set_ros_namespace("")

set_wifi_config：Configure the network information connected to the MicroROS control board

set_udp_config：Virtual machine IP address

set_car_type：Set the car type (currently there are virtual machine version and Raspberry Pi 
version)

set_ros_domain_id：Set the environment variable of ROS2 communication domain ID

set_ros_serial_baudrate：Set the baud rate for ROS serial communication

set_ros_namespace：Set the name of the multi-machine communication car



2、Configuration parameters  
Shortly press the reset button of the MicroROS control board (it is in the configuration state within 5 
seconds of reset), and enter the following command to configure the robot. If the data returned by 
the terminal is consistent with what you set, it means that the configuration parameters are 
successful!

sudo python3 config_robot.py

After the configuration is successful, you can unplug the data cable connecting the virtual machine 
and the MicroROS control board!



3. Start/connect the agent  
Start agent  

Using the virtual machine provided in our materials, run the following command:

sh ~/start_agent_computer.sh

connection broker  

Turn on the power switch and the car will automatically connect to the agent.

4、test  
View ROS nodes  

Reopen a terminal and enter the following command:

ros2 node list

Keyboard control car  

Enter the following command in the terminal and keep the mouse on the terminal: Control the car 
according to the terminal key prompts!

ros2 run yahboomcar_ctrl yahboom_keyboard
