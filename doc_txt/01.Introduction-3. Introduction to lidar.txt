3. Introduction to lidar  
As a low-cost measurement single-line high-precision lidar sensor, the MS200 radar adopts the TOF 
measurement method. The small size of the MS200 radar allows it to be built into the robot body, 
optimizing the space usage of the robot content. Although small in size, it integrates a variety of long-
distance measurement optimization algorithms, with a 90% reflectivity ranging range of up to 12.0m. 
At the same time, its power system uses a custom-optimized brushless DC motor with a service life of 
more than 10,000 hours.
