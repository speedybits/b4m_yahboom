Note: You must know the robot's username, password and IP address before logging in 
remotely. 

For example, in the picture below: IP address [192.168.2.119], user name [jetson], host name 
[yahboom].

Note: 

Yahboom Raspberry Pi version Muto RS image, username: pi, password: yahboom

Yahboom jetson nano version Muto RS image, username: jetson, password: yahboom

Just follow the login steps as shown in the picture. When using the vnc viewer software for VNC 
connection, you first need to query the IP address. You can query the IP address through the 
built-in OLED screen or by connecting the monitor to open a terminal and enter the ifconfig 
command. What I found here is [192.168.2.119]. Enter the IP address. Then click [Enter] on the 
keyboard.

Enter the corresponding VNC user password [yahboom], select Remember Password, and click 
[OK] to enter the VNC interface. 



There is no need to enter the password again when the IP remains unchanged next time.

Adjust resolution

Use the command line to adjust according to needs. It is only effective during this startup. Open

Raspberry Pi

Modify the [config.txt] file and it will be permanently effective. 

Open the terminal and enter the following command.
